    "Units are essential to engineering calculations. Units provide a quick check on all of our calculations to help reduce the number of errors in our analysis. Getting the right dimensions back from a calculation doesn't prove that the answer is correct, but getting the wrong dimensions back does prove that the answer is wrong! Unit errors from incorrect conversions are common when using apps that don't calculate with units. Engineering design work should always include units in the calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [pint package](https://pint.readthedocs.io/) to add unit capabilities to our calculations in Python. We have imported the `pint.UnitRegistry` as 'u' and thus all of pint's units can be used by placing a 'u.' in front of the unit name. Meters are `u.m`, seconds are `u.s`, etc. Most units are simple values that can be used just like other terms in algebraic equations. The exception to this are units that have an offset. For example, in the equation PV=nRT, temperature must be given with units that have value of zero at absolute zero. We would like to be able to enter 20 degC into that equation and have it handle the units correctly. But you can't convert from degC to Kelvin by simply multiplying by a conversion factor. Thus for temperature the units have to be handled in a special way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperatures require use of the u.Quantity function to enter the value and the units of temperature separated by a ',' rather than by a multiplication symbol. This is because it doesn't make sense to multiply by a temperature unit because temperatures (that aren't absolute temperatures) have both a slope and a nonzero intercept.\n",

This graph will have two sets of data: the real data contained within the csv file and some theoretical data. The theoretical data is what we would expect the headloss through the tube to be in an ideal world for any given flow. When calculating the theoretical headloss, assume that minor losses are negligible. Plot the data from the csv file as individual data points and the theoretical headloss as a continuous curve. Make the y-axis have units of cm and the x-axis have units of mL/s. \n",

These values shall be between the minimum and maximum flows in the csv file.\n",

Inputs for `np.linspace` are the same as they were for `np.logspace`, which was used in Problem 12a). Linspace does not work with units; you will need to remove the units (using `.magnitude`) from the inputs to `np.logspace` and then reattach the correct units of flow after creating the array.\n",

    "The theoretical model doesn't fit the data very well. We assumed that major losses dominated. But that assumption was wrong. So let's try a more sophisticated approach where we fit minor losses to the data. Below we demonstrate the use of the [scipy curve_fit method](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html#scipy.optimize.curve_fit) to fit the minor loss coefficient given this data set.  In this example, `Q_data` is the flow rate array for the csv file from problem 13. You should re-name this variable below to whatever you titled this variable."
