Since the Fall 2017 version of CEE 4540 used Jupyter notebooks instead of atom and hydrogen, the final reports were originally .ipynb files. They have been converted to .md files, but both the .ipynb version and the .md version can be found in each project folder. Both versions have the same file name.
