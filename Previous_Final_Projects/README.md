# Final Projects
This folder contains all final projects from previous years, organized by the year in which the project was done.
Within the folder for each year will be a similar README file containing a table of all the final projects that
were done that year. This table will contain the project title, group name, group members, and a brief description 
of the project.

The project folders themselves each contain a final report and a final presentation, in addition to any other files submitted
by the group. 

Reports will be named "**Team_Name_Project_Title_Report**," presentations will be named "**Team_Name_Project_Title_Presentation**,"
and auxilliary files will remain whatever their creators named them.
